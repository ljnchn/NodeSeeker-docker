# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves porting the NodeSeeker functionality from a Cloudflare Worker implementation to a Bun + Hono.js + SQLite stack. NodeSeeker appears to be a node discovery and monitoring service that tracks and manages network nodes or services. The ported version will maintain the core functionality while adapting to the new runtime environment and adding persistent storage capabilities through SQLite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to register and discover network nodes, so that I can maintain an up-to-date inventory of available services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new node registration request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the node information and store it in the database
2. WHEN a node discovery request is made THEN the system SHALL return a list of active nodes matching the specified criteria
3. IF a node registration contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
4. WHEN a node is successfully registered THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation with the node ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want nodes to periodically report their health status, so that I can monitor system availability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node health check is received THEN the system SHALL update the node's last seen timestamp and health status
2. WHEN a node hasn't reported within the configured timeout period THEN the system SHALL mark it as inactive
3. IF a health check contains invalid node ID THEN the system SHALL return an error response
4. WHEN querying node status THEN the system SHALL return current health information including last seen time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query nodes by various criteria, so that I can find specific services or filter by attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying nodes by type THEN the system SHALL return all nodes matching the specified type
2. WHEN querying nodes by status THEN the system SHALL return nodes with the requested status (active/inactive)
3. WHEN querying nodes by region or location THEN the system SHALL return geographically filtered results
4. IF no nodes match the query criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated cleanup of stale node records, so that the database doesn't accumulate outdated information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup cron job runs THEN the system SHALL identify nodes that haven't reported within the retention period
2. WHEN stale nodes are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them from the database
3. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL log the number of records removed
4. IF cleanup encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log the errors without stopping the process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes, so that I can integrate easily with the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with meaningful messages
3. WHEN successful operations complete THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses
4. IF request validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with validation error details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want persistent data storage, so that node information survives service restarts and provides historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the SQLite database with required tables
2. WHEN node data is stored THEN the system SHALL persist it to the SQLite database
3. WHEN the service restarts THEN the system SHALL retain all previously stored node information
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses
